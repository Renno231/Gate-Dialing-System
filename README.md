 This repository is home to the Gate Dialing System (GDS). GDS, designed and created by Renno231, is a two-tier architecture [Client-Server Network](https://www.heavy.ai/technical-glossary/client-server) created to operate a network of [Stargates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_(device)#:~:text=A%20Stargate%20is%20an%20Einstein%E2%80%93Rosen%20bridge%20portal%20device%20within%20the%20Stargate%20fictional%20universe%20that%20allows%20practical%2C%20rapid%20travel%20between%20two%20distant%20locations.%5B1%5D) in a fast, efficient, and effective manner. The system is written in Lua as a requirement of using [OpenComputers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/opencomputers), a Minecraft mod that simulates computers.
