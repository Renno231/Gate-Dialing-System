# Gate Dialing System
 The Gate Dialing system is a package of executable OpenComputers programs designed to emulate the Universial Dialers functionality from the Stargate fictional universe, but with many more features and greater usability. The primary features of GDS are extensibility and portability. GDS, when properly configured, allows users to create, maintain, and operate a network of Stargates. Unlike other Stargate-networking programs, GDS is a two-part system in which stationary computers (gate computers) wait for executable commands from user-operated tablets. To find out how to install and operate GDS, refer to the Wiki.
